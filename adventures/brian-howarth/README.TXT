Mysterious Adventures 
---------------------

Brian Howarth wrote his eleven "Mysterious Adventures" in 1981-83,
originally as text-only games (the way they are presented here).  Later
versions (Spectrum, C-64) had line-drawing graphics.  To play the
adventures in this archive you will need the interpreter "ScottFree".
You can get it from the Interactive Fiction Archive at ftp.gmd.de.

All datafiles are conversions from Spectrum/C-64 versions of the games
(but minus the graphics, as "ScottFree" does not support graphics at
the moment).  Brian Howarth gave his permission to upload the games
to the IF Archive.  Have fun, and happy nostalgia!

#1:  The Golden Baton

Your mission is to recover the Golden Baton, a priceless artefact that
holds within it a kind of life force that maintains the equilibrium between
good and evil.  Stolen from the Palace of King Ferrenuil, the kingdom is
already beginning to feel the effects of drought and pestilence.

#2:  The Time Machine

Trapped in a thick fog on the moors whilst searching for the house of Dr
Potter, you begin to wonder just what sort of a story will unfold for your
newspaper about the strange goings on that have been witnessed at this
home... that's if you ever find it.

#3:  Arrow of Death Part 1

Although restored to its rightful place in the throne room over 5 years ago
the Golden Baton which usually shines brighter than normal gold has suddenly
become tarnished, at the same time gloom and despair settles over the whole
kingdom.  Find the source of this evil influence before it is too late.

#4:  Arrow of Death Part 2

Having successfully completed Arrow of Death Part 1, you now have the
components to make a magical arrow with which you will be able to destroy
Zerdon, the evil accomplice of the Wizard Akyrz, the real mastermind behind
the evil that has befallen the Golden Baton.

#5:  Escape from Pulsar 7

As last surviving crew member of this ill-fated space freighter you must
somehow manage to make your escape in the frail shuttle craft without being
eaten by the mutant monster now roaming free.

#6:  Circus

What appears to be a circus in full swing from the distance suddenly becomes
as silent as the grave as you open the gate into the field.  Never the less
you must find some petrol for your car, so here goes...

#7:  Feasibility Experiment

A human guinea-pig for a race of super intelligent beings that have no
bodily form.  Plucked from your bed in order to satisfy their craving for
life force that will sustain them.  A warrior that can live up to the image
of Alexander the Great.

#8:  The Wizard of Akyrz

Twice defeated by a mere mortal it has taken the evil wizard some time to
recover his powers.  Now he forms a new plan to trap and utterly destroy the
earthly being that dares to thwart him.

#9:  Perseus and Andromeda

Take on the role of Perseus, son of Zeus and Danae.  Bring back the head of
Medusa the gorgon, whose very glance can turn a man to stone.  Otherwise
King Polydectes will have his wicked way.

#10:  Ten Little Indians

A train journey begins your quest for the golden idol left by Major
Johnston-Smythe when he died.  Other treasure hunters have tried before you,
most of them have never been seen again...

#11:  Waxworks

A nightmare comes true, you must find your way out of the wax works factory
in which all the exhibits mysteriously come alive.
