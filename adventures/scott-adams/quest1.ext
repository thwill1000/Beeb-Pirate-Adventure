(c) 1978-1984 by Scott Adams/Adventure International

The Hulk gets taken to a surreal otherworld for his testing by the Chief Examiner, and must find a way to survive in this alien environment while collecting a number of Gems. Noteworthy if only for the sheer number of times a certain command must be used.
